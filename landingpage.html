            <h2>AR/VR Headset Technology</h2>
            <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment that immerses users in a completely synthetic, digital experience. VR typically involves the use of a headset that covers the user's eyes, providing a fully immersive and isolated virtual world.</p>
           <h2>Types of VR:</h2>
            Tethered VR:
            These VR systems are connected to a powerful computer or gaming console.
            Examples include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR.</p>
           <p> Standalone VR:
            These headsets have all the necessary components built-in, eliminating the need for an external device.
            Examples include Oculus Quest and Lenovo Mirage Solo.</p>
          <p>  Mobile VR:
            VR experiences can be delivered using smartphones inserted into VR headsets.
            Examples include Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR.<p>

            <h2>Our Motive</h2>
            <p> Immersive Experience: VR creates a sense of presence, making users feel as if they are physically present in a computer-generated environment.</p>

               <p> Complete Isolation: Users are usually isolated from the real world, allowing them to fully engage with the virtual environment. </p>
                
              <p>  Diverse Applications: VR is utilized in various fields, including gaming, education, healthcare, training simulations, virtual tourism, and therapy.
                
               <p>Devices: VR experiences are primarily delivered through VR headsets, which can be tethered to a computer or operate as standalone devices.</p>
